# Description

This is a simple API to get MIDI information on notes such as the frequency or the name.
<br>
The JSON file containing all the notes from octave 0 to 8 has been parsed by myself thanks to [those informations](https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/notes.html).
<br>
You will also find some example of unit tests with the [MochaJS framework](https://mochajs.org/)
